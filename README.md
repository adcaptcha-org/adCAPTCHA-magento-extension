## Privacy Notices

adCAPTCHA adheres to GDPR regulations.

This plugin intentionally avoids the use of cookies, refrains from tracking users, storing personal data, or engaging with unnecessary external services during the verification process.

During verification, the adCAPTCHA service may briefly receive the user's IP address and browser vendor data to safeguard enabled pages. However, it promptly discards this information after verification and does not retain any data. Importantly, none of the information utilized for verification enables adCAPTCHA to identify individual users.
